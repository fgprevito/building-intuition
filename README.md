There are few things which we know which aren't capable of being reduced to a mathematical reasoning. And when they cannot, it is a sign that our knowldge of them is very small and confused. Where a math reasoning can be had, it is a great folly to make use of any other type of reasoning, as that would be like groping for a thing in the dark when you have a candle standing by you.



GOAL: Think in a high quality way

- To think in a high quality = be able to process reality mathematically
- The assignment I have been given to be able to train/demonstrate my ability to think in a high quality way is to analyze some economic data I have scraped from the web
- That said, I recognize that I have a bias heading into this. I haven't gone through the entire process before. I don't actually know what comes after I do this, I only have a vague understanding. This fact may affect my thinking process and how I interpret results and processes
- The first step to understanding this economic data is to see if I REALLY understand it. Can I reduce my understanding to mathematical reasoning? In other words, can I mathematically generate the data in a way that simulates reality reasonably well, in a way that I can easily manipulate in order to stress test for events that could affect my inputs/outputs?



- So, I want to prove I understand the data by mathematically reconstructing it. How do I go about this? Well we are going to try and understand it as something linear for now, in other words, the simplest mathematical expression I can find to try and express my knowledge of the world. So how do I go about doing this?
- Let's look at what I intuitively know about my data right now...
- Result: I want to be able to predict some kind of financial output (stock price, net income, etc). The important thing to keep in mind is the nature of the data and in any case, it's going to be some kind of continuous output
- Inputs: The data I want to be able to predict the financial output with, for now, are 3 categorical variables that consist of:
  1: the company
  2: the year
  3: the sector

- Summary: I am trying to predict a continuous variable using 3 categorical variables and I am assuming for now the relationship is something linear.

- So I am dealing with (lets say) stock price data as it is affected by 3 factors: The company, the year, and the sector

- I'll need to generate data for each of these factors
- The company, year, and sector data are all categorical variables
- Stock price data is a continuous variable
